### Metabolic Atlas Map Viewer 3D

This is a 3D graph viewer to visualize the metabolic atlas compound graph (metabolic network). See the [wiki](../../wiki) for more details.

Install dependencies with `npm install`, then run `npm run dev` to start the
development server, or `npm run prepare` to build and minify the
current version of the viewer.

The current version of the build is done with rollup, controlled by
`rollup.config.js`, and will bundle the app with three-js.
